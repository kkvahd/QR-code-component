## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Bootstrap Grid
- Bootstrap Card

### What I learned

The combination of Bootstrap classes, and the grid system can help me achieve fairly cumbersome tasks with only a few lines of code
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

This piece of code below was all I needed to develop this page

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="row h-100 justify-content-center align-items-center">
      <div class="col-12 d-flex justify-content-center">
        <div class="card" style="width: 20rem; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">
          <img class="card-img-top" src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="Card image cap">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title" style="font-weight: 900;">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h5>
            <p class="card-text" style="color: #afb0b4;">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding
              skills to the next level
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Has a crazy good grid system to organize content. Has several components that make your life easy. I used the "Card" component.
- [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/) - It has an amazing documentation on flexbox. This article is all you need to understand everything about flexboxes.
